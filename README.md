Multi-map campaign, based on the book Lord of the Clans by Christie Golden. Thrall's origin story. His journey from slave to becoming warchief of the horde.

The gameplay is supposed to be as fun as possible, but there are still plenty cinematics to watch.

- 9 playable maps + 3 cinematic-maps
- stealth, minigames, army-warfare
- unique and varied objectives
- lore-heavy storyline, set before Warcraft 3

[size=+1][color=#CCAA00]Release notes  from 2005:[/color][/size]
Phewww, made it :D After 2,5 years log and hard work I've finally managed to let a dream come true. Starting and finishing a project and giving people the chance to play it. Naturally, I didn't spend the whole time on this project, the truth is, I was leader of a clan, had to manage our Homepage and took a lot of time-outs to play other games. But all this I can do now without having to think that I still have work to do. I hope that you have at least as much fun playing this as I had creating it.

This campaign can only be distributed with this Readme-Document. send complaints, praise, hints and information to alexandrosdelas [at] gmail [dot] com . As long as I am not on vacation or in jail (joking^^... I'm never on vacation ;-D) I will answer every E-Mail on the next day.
